Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, think of it as a framework for managing a process.\r\n\r\nIn the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.\r\n\r\nThis is why in Scrum development, for example, a sprint planning meeting is described in terms of the desired outcome (a commitment to a set of features to be developed in the next sprint) instead of a set of Entry criteria, Task definitions, Validation criteria, Exit criteria (ETVX) and so on, as would be provided in most methodologies.\r\n\r\nScrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd in Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.\r\n\r\nWithin agile development, Scrum teams are supported by two specific roles. The first is a ScrumMaster, who can be thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the Scrum process to perform at the highest level.\r\n\r\nThe product owner (PO) is the other role, and in Scrum software development, represents the business, customers or users, and guides the team toward building the right product.\r\n<h2>Scrum Development: What’s Involved?</h2>\r\nThe Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.\r\n\r\nScrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog – a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.\r\n\r\nDuring an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are done, meaning coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.\r\n\r\nOn each day of the sprint, all team members should attend a daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum model sees daily scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a sprint, the team conducts a sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.\r\n\r\nThis feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.\r\n\r\nAnother activity in Scrum project management is the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the ScrumMaster and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.\r\n<h2>Scrum Process: The Main Artifacts</h2>\r\nThe primary artifact in Scrum development is, of course, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint.\r\n\r\nThe product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The product owner prioritizes the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.\r\n\r\nThe most popular and successful way to create a product backlog using Scrum methodology is to populate it with user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer.\r\n\r\nIn Scrum project management, on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting, team members create the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog can be thought of as the team\'s to-do list for the sprint, whereas a product backlog is a list of features to be built (written in the form of user stories).\r\n\r\nThe sprint backlog is the list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the functionality it committed to deliver during the sprint.\r\n\r\nAdditional artifacts resulting from the Scrum agile methodology is the sprint burndown chart and release burndown chart. Burndown charts show the amount of work remaining either in a sprint or a release, and are an effective tool in Scrum software development to determine whether a sprint or release is on schedule to have all planned work finished by the desired date.\r\n<h2>The Agile Scrum Project: Main Roles</h2>\r\nEven if you are new to Scrum, you may have heard of a role called the ScrumMaster. The ScrumMaster is the team\'s coach, and helps Scrum practitioners achieve their highest level of performance.\r\n\r\nIn the Scrum process, a ScrumMaster differs from a traditional project manager in many ways, including that this role does not provide day-to-day direction to the team and does not assign tasks to individuals.\r\n\r\nA good ScrumMaster shelters the team from outside distractions, allowing team members to focus maniacally during the sprint on the goal they have selected.\r\n\r\nWhile the ScrumMaster focuses on helping the team be the best that it can be, the product owner works to direct the team to the right goal. The product owner does this by creating a compelling vision of the product, and then conveying that vision to the team through the product backlog.\r\n\r\nThe product owner is responsible for prioritizing the backlog during Scrum development, to ensure it’s up to par as more is learned about the system being built, its users, the team and so on.\r\n\r\nThe third and final role in Scrum project management is the Scrum team itself. Although individuals may join the team with various job titles, in Scrum, those titles are insignificant. Scrum methodology states that each person contributes in whatever way they can to complete the work of each sprint.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that a tester will be expected to re-architect the system; individuals will spend most (and sometimes all) of their time working in whatever discipline they worked before adopting the agile Scrum model. But with Scrum, individuals are expected to work beyond their preferred disciplines whenever doing so would be for the good of the team.\r\n\r\nOne way to think of the interlocking nature of these three roles in this agile methodology is as a racecar.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum team is the car itself, ready to speed along in whatever direction it is pointed. The product owner is the driver, making sure that the car is always going in the right direction. And the ScrumMaster is the chief mechanic, keeping the car well tuned and performing at its best.','Scrum','','inherit','closed','closed','','113-revision-v1','','','2016-06-02 21:13:02','2016-06-02 21:13:02','',113,'http://know-corp.com/113-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(7,1,'2016-05-29 04:11:24','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','closed','closed','','','','','2016-05-29 04:11:24','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://know-corp.com/?page_id=7',0,'page','',0),(113,1,'2016-06-02 21:13:02','2016-06-02 21:13:02','Scrum is an agile way to manage a project, usually software development.

src=\"http://know-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Time-Saving-Benefits-Twitter-900x450-300x150.png\" alt=\"Time-Saving-Benefits-Twitter-900x450\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" />\r\n<p>Physical labor is one of the most strangely enduring mental models for knowledge work.</p>\r\n<p>Directors and managers of software development the world over reactively employ it when nudged out of their comfort zones, for instance. \"What do you mean ‘pair programming’ \" we’ll get half of the work done for the same payout in salary!\"</p>\r\n<p>And that’d be a reasonable argument if the value of software were measured in \"characters typed per minute.\"</p>\r\n<p>Most of the skepticism when asking: <em>\"why do unit testing?\"</em> or&nbsp;<em>\"<a href=\"https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/why-review-code/\">why do code reviews?</a>\"</em> originates from this same \"knowledge work as labor\" confusion.</p>\r\n<p>The core value of software resides in the verbatim contents of the source code files, so stuffing all of the features in them ahead of the deadline is critical. Testing and reviewing are \"nice-to-haves\", time and budget permitting.</p>\r\n<p>The classic response from people arguing for these practices is thus one of&nbsp;<em>worth</em>.

size-medium wp-image-59\" /><p>Physical labor is one of the most strangely enduring mental models for knowledge work.</p>\n\nDirectors and managers of software development the world over reactively employ it when nudged out of their comfort zones, for instance. “What do you mean ‘pair programming’ — we’ll get half of the work done for the same payout in salary!”\nAnd that’d be a reasonable argument if the value of software were measured in “characters typed per minute.”\n\nMost of the skepticism when asking: &lt;em&gt;“why do unit testing?”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=\"https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/why-review-code/\"&gt;why do code reviews?&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; originates from this same “knowledge work as labor” confusion.\n\nThe core value of software resides in the verbatim contents of the source code files, so stuffing all of the features in them ahead of the deadline is critical. Testing and reviewing are “nice-to-haves”, time and budget permitting.\n\nThe classic response from people arguing for these practices is thus one of &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt;. It goes something like this: “sure, you can cut those activities, but your quality will dip and there will be more escaped defects.”\n\nIn other words, these ‘extra’ activities pay for themselves by making your outfit look less amateurish.\n\nThat argument often works, but not always. Some decision-makers have their backs truly to the wall, saying “I don’t care about quality — my job depends on shipping on June 19th, and we’re GOING to ship on June 19th, whether it’s a finished product or whether it’s a bag of broken kazoos and cyanide with a bow on it.”\n\nI’d like to take a different tack today and fight a time argument with time arguments. Instead of “sure, code reviews take extra time but they’re worth it,” I’d like to explore ways that they actually &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; time.\n\nWhether they save more time than they take is going to vary widely by situation, so please don’t mistake my intent; I’m not looking to argue that they’ll save you net time, but rather that they are not exclusively an investment of time.\n&lt;h2&gt;Others’ Time&lt;/h2&gt;\nIf your organization is largely silo-ed, this might not immediately occur to you, but the organization pays salary to folks other than the software developers, including testers, operations people, helpdesk, field support, etc. And because it pays these salaries, the organization cares how those people spend their time.\n\nIf you code up a defect that escapes into production, then yes, you (or someone in your group) are going to spend time fixing it. And, yes, it’ll &lt;a href=\"http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/costOfChange.htm\"&gt;probably take you longer to fix the later you catch it&lt;/a&gt;. But it will also take a lot more than just you or one of your cohorts to fix it.\n\nThere’s the helpdesk tech that fields the call and spends time with the customer trying to reproduce it. There are the tier 2 and 3 people to whom the issues is escalated, and the operations folks with whom they work to see if the problem can be addressed with a configuration management approach. On the other side of it, assuming code changes are necessary, there is the tester that has to validate the fix in each environment as it’s promoted.\n\nContrast this with what happens if a code review catches this bug; the reduction in the dev team’s time to fix is a drop in the bucket compared to the holistic savings from all of the people I’ve mentioned not having to do any work on this at all.\n&lt;h2&gt;Bob’s Vacation&lt;/h2&gt;\nI hear a lot of companies talk about “&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\"&gt;bus factor&lt;/a&gt;,” which is a macabre visual for the degree to which team members have special, bottleneck-creating knowledge. “Oh, that’s Bob’s section of the code, and he’s the only one that should touch it” is a classic symptom of a group with a high bus factor. Code review dramatically mitigates this by promoting &lt;a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html\"&gt;collective code ownership&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nBut forget for a moment about “bus factor” and let’s consider the more benign “vacation factor.” If Bob is hit by a bus, everyone knows what to do the next day — they immediately start everyone on a crash course in Bob’s code. But if Bob goes to Bermuda for two weeks, not so much.\n\nI’ve seen heavily silo-ed groups completely alter project schedules because Bob has a vacation scheduled. “Oh, there’s no way the new feature set goes out in August as planned because, remember, Bob always takes his vacation in late July.” The business loses two weeks of calendar time to Bob’s specialized knowledge.\n\nIn a world with routine code review, things don’t go this way, and you get those two weeks back.\n&lt;h2&gt;Onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;\nCollective code ownership helps not only when people go on vacation, but when new people start with the team as well. A team in the regular habit of sharing knowledge will be able to bring a newbie up to speed much, much faster.\n\nI’ve seen shops where tenured developers were overworked to the point of stress, but  newbies would sit around for literally months, twiddling their thumbs and trying to figure out how to be useful. I consider that to be a completely unacceptable and ludicrous state of affairs, and yet, it’s surprisingly common.\n\nCode review won’t eliminate the time needed to grasp a problem domain, but it does force interaction between newbies and experienced folks, which significantly reduces onboarding time.\n&lt;h2&gt;Bad Habit Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;\nA final time-saver that I’ll mention is the subtle one of bad habit prevention. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen a programmer develop and repeat a habit for months, only to learn later, in passing, that the habit is problematic. Perhaps it’s something that prevents all of their code from being used in multi-threaded contexts or something that invites a memory leak.\n\nOnce this is revealed to the now-crestfallen developer, he has two choices: leave the problematic code in place, hoping for the best, or undertake a massive effort to go back and change all such code from the last number of months. Most shops, sooner or later, wind up going the latter route.\n\nWhat an utter waste of time — an early code review could have prevented the rework and stopped the developer from acquiring a bad habit that might manifest itself from time to time, even going forward.\n&lt;h2&gt;Time Savings is Only Part of the Whole&lt;/h2&gt;\nIf you adopt or expand your &lt;a href=\"https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/\"&gt;code review practice&lt;/a&gt;, you will save time in the ways I’ve outlined here. Will it be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time than you spend doing the reviews? I honestly have no idea.\n\nBut also recall that it doesn’t entirely matter. The standard arguments about code review improving quality, enhancing collaboration, spreading knowledge, etc. still apply. Code review has a lot of benefits besides simple time savings. But it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; going to save you some time here and there in ways you hadn’t previously considered.\n&lt;h2&gt;Improving Code Quality and Collaboration On Your Development Team&lt;/h2&gt;\nSoftware quality is driven by collaboration throughout the entire development lifecycle. This requires tools that support the process. These tools include integrated development environments, build and test automation tools, requirements management and bug tracking tools, as well as peer review tools.','The Hidden Time-Saving Benefits of Code Reviews','','inherit','closed','closed','','58-autosave-v1','','','2016-06-02 23:34:00','2016-06-02 23:34:00','',58,'http://know-corp.com/58-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(83,1,'2016-06-01 22:04:45','2016-06-01 22:04:45','Welcome to WordPress.

Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, think of it as a framework for managing a process.\n\nIn the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.\n\nThis is why in Scrum development, for example, a sprint planning meeting is described in terms of the desired outcome (a commitment to a set of features to be developed in the next sprint) instead of a set of Entry criteria, Task definitions, Validation criteria, Exit criteria (ETVX) and so on, as would be provided in most methodologies.\n\nScrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team as a whole.\n\nAnd in Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.\n\nWithin agile development, Scrum teams are supported by two specific roles. The first is a ScrumMaster, who can be thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the Scrum process to perform at the highest level.\n\nThe product owner (PO) is the other role, and in Scrum software development, represents the business, customers or users, and guides the team toward building the right product.\n<h2>Scrum Development: What’s Involved?</h2>\nThe Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.\n\nScrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog – a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.\n\nDuring an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are done, meaning coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.\n\nOn each day of the sprint, all team members should attend a daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress.\n\nThe Scrum model sees daily scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint.\n\nAt the end of a sprint, the team conducts a sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.\n\nThis feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.\n\nAnother activity in Scrum project management is the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the ScrumMaster and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.\n<h2>Scrum Process: The Main Artifacts</h2>\nThe primary artifact in Scrum development is, of course, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint.\n\nThe product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The product owner prioritizes the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.\n\nThe most popular and successful way to create a product backlog using Scrum methodology is to populate it with user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer.\n\nIn Scrum project management, on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting, team members create the sprint backlog.

Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, think of it as a framework for managing a process.\r\nIn the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.\r\n\r\nThis is why in Scrum development, for example, a sprint planning meeting is described in terms of the desired outcome (a commitment to a set of features to be developed in the next sprint) instead of a set of Entry criteria, Task definitions, Validation criteria, Exit criteria (ETVX) and so on, as would be provided in most methodologies.\r\n\r\nScrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd in Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.\r\n\r\nWithin agile development, Scrum teams are supported by two specific roles. The first is a ScrumMaster, who can be thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the Scrum process to perform at the highest level.\r\n\r\nThe product owner (PO) is the other role, and in Scrum software development, represents the business, customers or users, and guides the team toward building the right product.\r\n<h2>Scrum Development: What’s Involved?</h2>\r\nThe Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.\r\n\r\nScrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog – a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.\r\n\r\nDuring an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are done, meaning coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.\r\n\r\nOn each day of the sprint, all team members should attend a daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum model sees daily scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a sprint, the team conducts a sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.\r\n\r\nThis feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.\r\n\r\nAnother activity in Scrum project management is the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the ScrumMaster and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.\r\n<h2>Scrum Process: The Main Artifacts</h2>\r\nThe primary artifact in Scrum development is, of course, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint.\r\n\r\nThe product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The product owner prioritizes the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.\r\n\r\nThe most popular and successful way to create a product backlog using Scrum methodology is to populate it with user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer.\r\n\r\nIn Scrum project management, on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting, team members create the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog can be thought of as the team\'s to-do list for the sprint, whereas a product backlog is a list of features to be built (written in the form of user stories).\r\n\r\nThe sprint backlog is the list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the functionality it committed to deliver during the sprint.\r\n\r\nAdditional artifacts resulting from the Scrum agile methodology is the sprint burndown chart and release burndown chart. Burndown charts show the amount of work remaining either in a sprint or a release, and are an effective tool in Scrum software development to determine whether a sprint or release is on schedule to have all planned work finished by the desired date.\r\n<h2>The Agile Scrum Project: Main Roles</h2>\r\nEven if you are new to Scrum, you may have heard of a role called the ScrumMaster.

reactively employ it when nudged out of their comfort zones, for instance. “What do you mean ‘pair programming’ — we’ll get half of the work done for the same payout in salary!”\r\n\r\nAnd that’d be a

href=\"https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/why-review-code/\">why do code reviews?</a>“</em> originates from this same “knowledge work as labor” confusion.\r\n\r\nThe core value of software resides in the verbatim contents of the source code files, so stuffing all of the features in them ahead of the deadline is critical. Testing and reviewing are “nice-to-haves”, time and budget permitting.\r\n\r\nThe classic response from people arguing for these practices is thus one of <em>worth</em>. It goes something like this: “sure, you can cut those activities, but your quality will dip and there will be more escaped defects.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, these ‘extra’ activities pay for themselves by making your outfit look less amateurish.\r\n\r\nThat argument often works, but not always. Some decision-makers have their backs truly to the wall, saying “I don’t care about quality — my job depends on shipping on June 19th, and we’re GOING to ship on June 19th, whether it’s a finished product or whether it’s a bag of broken kazoos and cyanide with a bow on it.”\r\n\r\nI’d like to take a different tack today and fight a time argument with time arguments. Instead of “sure, code reviews take extra time but they’re worth it,” I’d like to explore ways that they actually <em>save</em> time.\r\n\r\nWhether they save more time than they take is going to vary widely by situation, so please don’t mistake my intent; I’m not looking to argue that they’ll save you net time, but rather that they are not exclusively an investment of time.\r\n<h2>Others’ Time</h2>\r\nIf your organization is largely silo-ed, this might not immediately occur to you, but the organization pays salary to folks other than the software developers, including testers, operations people, helpdesk, field support, etc. And because it pays these salaries, the organization cares how those people spend their time.\r\n\r\nIf you code up a defect that escapes into production, then yes, you (or someone in your group) are going to spend time fixing it. And, yes, it’ll <a href=\"http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/costOfChange.htm\">probably take you longer to fix the later you catch it</a>. But it will also take a lot more than just you or one of your cohorts to fix it.\r\n\r\nThere’s the helpdesk tech that fields the call and spends time with the customer trying to reproduce it. There are the tier 2 and 3 people to whom the issues is escalated, and the operations folks with whom they work to see if the problem can be addressed with a configuration management approach. On the other side of it, assuming code changes are necessary, there is the tester that has to validate the fix in each environment as it’s promoted.\r\n\r\nContrast this with what happens if a code review catches this bug; the reduction in the dev team’s time to fix is a drop in the bucket compared to the holistic savings from all of the people I’ve mentioned not having to do any work on this at all.\r\n<h2>Bob’s Vacation</h2>\r\nI hear a lot of companies talk about “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\">bus factor</a>,” which is a macabre visual for the degree to which team members have special, bottleneck-creating knowledge. “Oh, that’s Bob’s section of the code, and he’s the only one that should touch it” is a classic symptom of a group with a high bus factor. Code review dramatically mitigates this by promoting <a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html\">collective code ownership</a>.\r\n\r\nBut forget for a moment about “bus factor” and let’s consider the more benign “vacation factor.” If Bob is hit by a bus, everyone knows what to do the next day — they immediately start everyone on a crash course in Bob’s code. But if Bob goes to Bermuda for two weeks, not so much.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen heavily silo-ed groups completely alter project schedules because Bob has a vacation scheduled. “Oh, there’s no way the new feature set goes out in August as planned because, remember, Bob always takes his vacation in late July.” The business loses two weeks of calendar time to Bob’s specialized knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn a world with routine code review, things don’t go this way, and you get those two weeks back.\r\n<h2>Onboarding</h2>\r\nCollective code ownership helps not only when people go on vacation, but when new people start with the team as well. A team in the regular habit of sharing knowledge will be able to bring a newbie up to speed much, much faster.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen shops where tenured developers were overworked to the point of stress, but  newbies would sit around for literally months, twiddling their thumbs and trying to figure out how to be useful. I consider that to be a completely unacceptable and ludicrous state of affairs, and yet, it’s surprisingly common.\r\n\r\nCode review won’t eliminate the time needed to grasp a problem domain, but it does force interaction between newbies and experienced folks, which significantly reduces onboarding time.\r\n<h2>Bad Habit Prevention</h2>\r\nA final time-saver that I’ll mention is the subtle one of bad habit prevention. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen a programmer develop and repeat a habit for months, only to learn later, in passing, that the habit is problematic. Perhaps it’s something that prevents all of their code from being used in multi-threaded contexts or something that invites a memory leak.\r\n\r\nOnce this is revealed to the now-crestfallen developer, he has two choices: leave the problematic code in place, hoping for the best, or undertake a massive effort to go back and change all such code from the last number of months. Most shops, sooner or later, wind up going the latter route.\r\n\r\nWhat an utter waste of time — an early code review could have prevented the rework and stopped the developer from acquiring a bad habit that might manifest itself from time to time, even going forward.\r\n<h2>Time Savings is Only Part of the Whole</h2>\r\nIf you adopt or expand your <a href=\"https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/\">code review practice</a>, you will save time in the ways I’ve outlined here. Will it be <em>more</em> time than you spend doing the reviews? I honestly have no idea.\r\n\r\nBut also recall that it doesn’t entirely matter. The standard arguments about code review improving quality, enhancing collaboration, spreading knowledge, etc. still apply. Code review has a lot of benefits besides simple time savings. But it’s <em>also</em> going to save you some time here and there in ways you hadn’t previously considered.\r\n<h2>Improving Code Quality and Collaboration On Your Development Team</h2>\r\nSoftware quality is driven by collaboration throughout the entire development lifecycle.

There are agreed upon requirements and tasks to complete prior to the closure of project. These constitute the scope of the project. Any amount of variation in the scope of project can affect the schedule, budget and in turn the success of project.\r\n\r\nScoping is the separation between what is included in and what is excluded from project. Scope creep occurs when the line is moved, usually outwards. Thus what was excluded is now included, making a project in most cases larger.\r\n\r\nAccording to the PMBOK, scope creep is defined as adding features and functionality (project scope) without addressing the effects on time, costs, and resources, or without customer approval. This phenomenon can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered a negative occurrence that is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have participated (not as a project lead or a project manager) in a number of projects that failed due to scope creep. I could not find any formal statistics to refer to, however, I\'ve noted that majority of those projects failed due some form of scope creep.

There are agreed upon requirements and tasks to complete prior to the closure of project. These constitute the scope of the project. Any amount of variation in the scope of project can affect the schedule, budget and in turn the success of project.\r\n\r\nScoping is the separation between what is included in and what is excluded from project. Scope creep occurs when the line is moved, usually outwards. Thus what was excluded is now included, making a project in most cases larger.\r\n\r\nAccording to the PMBOK, scope creep is defined as adding features and functionality (project scope) without addressing the effects on time, costs, and resources, or without customer approval. This phenomenon can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered a negative occurrence that is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have participated (not as a project lead or a project manager) in a number of projects that failed due to scope creep. I could not find any formal statistics to refer to, however, I\'ve noted that majority of those projects failed due some form of scope creep. Note that the PMBOK considers a project as failed anytime it is over budget or does not meet the predetermined schedule deadline.\r\n\r\nScope creep can originate from:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Poor implementation of change control</li>\r\n 	<li>Incomplete gathering of requirements before the beginning of project execution</li>\r\n 	<li>Insufficient involvement of critical stakeholders (including the customer)</li>\r\n 	<li>Lack of support from the executive sponsor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nScope creep can be classified as:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Technical Scope Creep</li>\r\n 	<li>Business Scope Creep</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe technical scope creep can show up when the project team wants to please the customer and is not able to reject the customer\'s request for a change in the requirements during project execution.
